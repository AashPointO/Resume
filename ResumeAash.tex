		\item
			I converted thousands of lines of code of the mathematical intensive operations of an aircraft landing simulation from MATLAB to C, enabling the simulation to run twice as fast. My conversion is now used in research and development of the actual aircraft landing system, which is installed in the worldâ€™s most expensive aircraft carriers.
		\item
			Only intern in department of 20 to earn "Most Valuable Player" award for saving "hundreds of hours in simulation time and greatly reduce control system tuning efforts."
		\item
			I created and presented several PowerPoint Presentations detailing the general process of the aircraft landing system, which are still being used for teaching new employees.

			Wrote backend database in MATLAB to track participants in a behavioral study we were conducting.
		\item
			Revised and made modifications to MATLAB study simulation source code to ensure that all output data from each participant were recorded in their own separate repositories.
		\item 
			Assisted in actual running of the behavioral study, creating an outline of the study to be given to each participant, and scheduling participants for future trials.
