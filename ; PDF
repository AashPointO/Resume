		\item
			I converted thousands of lines of code of the mathematical intensive algorithms of an aircraft landing simulation from MATLAB to C, enabling the simulation to run more than twice as fast as its original speed. My conversion is now used in research and development of the actual aircraft landing system contracted for the worldâ€™s most expensive aircraft carriers.
		\item
			Only intern in department of 20 to earn "Most Valuable Player" award for saving "hundreds of hours in simulation time and greatly reduce control system tuning efforts."
		\item
			I created and Presented several PowerPoint Presentations detailing the general process of the aircraft landing system, which are now being used for teaching new employees.

			Wrote Arduino software which takes in digital inputs from buttons, and analog data from multiple audio jacks, and relays this information to our EEG acquisition program through soldered serial pins. Crucial in accurately interpreting data of brain wave patterns in response to audio cues from our behavioral studies.
		\item 
			Wrote a MATLAB wrapper which grabs the gaze angle from our eye tracker through the Lab Streaming Layer API. Designed as a proof of concept to be incorporated into future studies which will require eye tracking data.
		\item
			Wrote backend database in MATLAB to track participants in our studies.
